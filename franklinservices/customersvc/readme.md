# Customer SVC

This is a submodule that is going to use the managed dependencies form the parent project.

Follow the N-Tier architecture: 

- Create a Controller to define the routes of our API calls.

- Create a Service to add the business logic.

- Create a Data Model class to represent our business objects.

Why to use a record and not a class ? we get in immutability for free.

Record is an immutable class, i.e. all its fields are final. Records are implicitly final, hence as well as regular final class record can't be extended.

Records are meant to be "transparent carriers for immutable data" as JEP 395 says.

They are designed to be concise, default constructor, getters, hashCode/equals and toString() will be generated by the compiler for you.
